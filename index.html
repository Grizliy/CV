    <h1>Hannah Ng</h1>
    <p><em>Student of <strong><a href="https://www2.sttss.edu.my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STTSS</strong></a> and aspiring coder</em></p>
    <!--It's good practice to use <em> instead of <i> and <strong> instead of <bold> (although they deliver the same effect visually, it's more important in HTML especially to emphasize the text instead of just styling them)-->
    <p>I'm a student studying full-time in high school STTSS. I also partake in various after-school activities in extra-curriculum such as participating in academic essay competitions. I also try to make it a habit to study when I get home from school to equip myself well for the upcoming Unified Examination of Malaysia. Right now I'm coding to become a web developer, and hopefully be able to create beautiful websites in the future!:)</p>
